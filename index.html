  <div class="text"><p>Welcome to Salt Lake City Dental Center’s webpage, home
    of your new Salt Lake City Dentist, Dr. Brigham Stoker DDS! We hope this
    site will help you get to know our dental practice a little bit better and
    be useful in helping you make your choice of dentists in Salt Lake. Our
    goal is to create a site that helps you, as a dental patient, gain a
    greater understanding of modern dentistry and the dental services we offer
    to all patients, with or without dental insurance. As our website grows, we
    will continue adding educational content and stories of real patients
    receiving the treatments they need in our Salt Lake dental clinic.  We hope
     to help you understand concepts like how getting tooth fillings before
     cavities progress too far can help avoid more costly procedures, how to
     know when you may need a dental crown, how a root canal isnt as bad as
     you think, how mini dental implants can stabilize your existing dentures,
     and how standard dental implants are changing dentistry. And ultimately,
     we want to demonstrate that whether you are looking for basic tooth
     whitening or a full mouth reconstruction, we will do our best to provide
     the same high quality of service and comfort to every patient. Take a look
      around our site, and check back for updates soon. Thanks for visiting
      !</p></div>

<div class = "text"><p>“After years of poor dental work done on my 2 back
  molars I finally found my Super Dentist! He saved my mouth from years of
  torture. I thought I was going to have to pull them both and I was just
  starting to get used to the idea because the pain of my gums was just too
  much to bare. Strangely enough that didn’t even come up in conversation. He
  fixed both of my sub-par crowns, took out the old silver remnants that was
  possibly causing some of the pain. He said I could have been allergic to
   the metal trapped under my crowns that none of the other dentists cleared
   out and the shape of the old crowns were trapping everything that went in
   and I couldn’t get it out. Now just 1 week later, my gums feel like nothing
   was ever wrong and my horrid tooth aches are gone! I mean honestly! I will
    be recommending Dr Stoker to all my friends and family. He is amazing and
    his staff is great too. I still can’t believe he fixed it! This is like 5
    dentists later. It’s amazing.” Heather H.</p>

<div class = "text"><p>“Everyone knows that the first time that you see a new
   dentist it is the most nerve racking experience. When I walked into his
   office his staff automatically made me at easy. Dr. Stoker and his staff
   teat you with the respectable and best possible care. They also are great at
    explaining what is needed to complete your dental needs. This was the best
    part and experience that I have ever had. Dr. Stoker seems to have the most
    equipment as it appears to me. I had some problems with pain Dr. Stoker and
    his staff was able to help resolve it and explain it to so that I could
    understand. Would I recommend him and his staff that is an astounding yes.”
